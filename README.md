Steps to clone project:
 1. Clone project to a local file
 2. open the project within Xcode on 'OrbitV2App' 
 3. One project is open, click on the project name in the directory. On the 'Info' tab, make sure 'Deployment Target' is 16.4, and check in 'Build Settings' for 'Base SDK' to be 'iOS'.
 4. Then select under where it says 'Targets' the only one that should be there. Then navigate to the 'Info' tab similar to before, and add a 'Application Scene Manifesto' to the list and configure it to the screenshot attached.<img width="828" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-22 at 2 43 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26227901/233803639-0790f6bd-8d25-4323-ad64-a4fd24f3b887.png">
